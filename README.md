# Drumkit
A drum set – also called a drum kit, trap set (an abbreviation of the word "contraption")[1] or simply drums – is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[2] with drumsticks held in both hands and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum.
